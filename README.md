# Machine Learning: Linear Regressions with one variable

This is simply a python implementation of some homework from the machine learning course on Course by Andrew Ng:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

The project is written in Python 3, using parts of the SciPy stack to make certain parts easier.

That said, not all of the power of SciPy is used to make this implementation the best it could be - this is created solely for educational purposes
